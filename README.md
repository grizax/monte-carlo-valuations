# Monte Carlo Methods

Monte Carlo methods are computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. 

Monte Carlo methods vary, but generally follow a pattern:

	1. Define a domain of possible inputs
	2. Generate inputs randomly from a probability distribution over the domain
	3. Perform a deterministic computation of the inputs
	4. Aggregate the results


# Call Options

A call option, often simply labeled a "call", is a financial contract between two parties, the buyer and the seller of this type of option.[1] The buyer of the call option has the right, but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the strike price). The seller (or "writer") is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument to the buyer if the buyer so decides. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right.

When you buy a call option, you are buying the right to buy a stock at the strike price, regardless of the stock price in the future before the expiration date. Conversely, you can short or "write" the call option, giving the buyer the right to buy that stock from you anytime before the option expires. To compensate you for that risk taken, the buyer pays you a premium, also known as the price of the call. The seller of the call is said to have shorted the call option, and keeps the premium (the amount the buyer pays to buy the option) whether or not the buyer ever exercises the option.

Exact specifications may differ depending on option style. A *European* call option allows the holder to exercise the option (i.e., to buy) only on the option expiration date. An *American* call option allows exercise at any time during the life of the option.
